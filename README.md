# terrible-ui
Collection of bad UI items. 

Based on a Reddit post 'Please enter your phone number', there is now a collection of terrible ways to enter a phone number.

I thought it would be fun to recreate some of these, and even create a few new ones. 
To make it a little bit more diverse, I decided to also add some other bad UIs, such as buttons that won't respond or forcing a user to 'type' on a virtual keyboard. 

This project is just a simple collection of terrible user interfaces. 

This project will be written in basic HTML/CSS/Javascript
